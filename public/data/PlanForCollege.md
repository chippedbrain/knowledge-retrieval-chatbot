#### Explore Types of Colleges
What do we mean by college? It’s any education beyond high school. Let’s explore the differences between each type of school and the degrees you can earn.

Colleges and Universities (four-year) offer bachelor’s degrees and advanced degrees, which may include master’s degrees and doctorates.
Examples of professions that require these types of degrees:

Bachelor’s – Accountant, Teacher, Journalist
Master’s – Psychologist, Physician Assistant, Librarian
Doctorate – Medical Doctor, Lawyer, Pharmacist
Community Colleges (two-year) offer certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees. Many courses will transfer to a four-year college.

Examples of professions that require these types of degrees:

Certificate – Construction Worker, Certified Nursing Assistant, Welder
Diploma – Computer Repairperson, Paralegal, Electrician
Associate’s – HVAC Technician, Accounting Assistant, Chef
Career Schools (for-profit) specialize in trades like technology, business, or cosmetology. Most offer certificates and diplomas, while some offer bachelor’s degrees.

Apprenticeships are opportunities that provide both on-the-job training and classroom learning. You’ll take classes through a community college or other training provider that leads to a nationally recognized qualification.

Military Service provides training in a variety of career fields that can often apply to civilian occupations. Talk to a military recruiter for details.

Use a planner or homework app to record assignments.
Take notes from the lecture or reading assignments (try Rocketbook).
Store your notes digitally so you can review them from any device (try Evernote).
Make flashcards to test your knowledge (try Quizlet).
Ask questions if you don’t understand the material.
Find a place to study with no distractions.
Get involved. Scholarship donors and colleges are looking for well-rounded students, so get involved in school and community activities! Use our Activities Resume to track your activities, awards, volunteerism, and paid jobs. This information will be useful when applying for college admission, scholarships, and part-time jobs.

#### Zero-in on College
When deciding on a college, it’s critical to find the best fit for you. Here’s how:

Research colleges. Use College Profiles to find schools that meet your criteria and to narrow your college selection. You can filter schools by major, enrollment size, location, and cost. Compare the costs of Nebraska colleges with this chart.

Go online. Review college websites to discover their top academic programs and explore life on campus. You can often schedule campus visits right from their websites.

Get on campus!  Schedule a campus visit at least two weeks in advance. Ask for appointments with an admissions rep, financial aid advisor, and professor in your field of interest. After your tour, walk around campus and ask students what they think about the school. Eat in the cafeteria, check out the dorms, and walk the neighborhood to get a feel for the overall community.

Ask lots of questions. Here are a few to get you started. Find more questions here.

What are admission requirements and deadlines?
Do you have academic programs that fit my career interests?
What is the cost of tuition and fees, housing and food, and books?
How do I apply for college-based scholarships?
What housing options are available?
Are jobs available on campus?
What percentage of students graduate?
Take plenty of notes so you can compare schools based on the criteria that matter to you most.

#### Take the Tests
You have taken standardized exams for years, but the tests you take in high school might determine scholarships you can earn and, in some cases, the college you attend. Some colleges are now test-optional.

PSAT/NMSQT. You may take this test as a sophomore. The questions and format are similar to the SAT with reading, math, science, and language sections. The results may qualify you for scholarships like the National Merit Scholarship Program.

ACT. Nebraskans take the ACT in the spring of your junior year. It’s free because it’s mandated by the state. The ACTS covers English, math, reading, science, and includes an optional writing section.

SAT. This exam is more commonly used for schools on the east and west coasts and covers the same test subjects as the ACT, including an optional writing section.

To get the best ACT/SAT scores possible, retake the exam(s) in the summer and fall. You can also retake a single subject of the ACT. If the fee is difficult for your family to pay, ask your school counselor about a waiver.

Prep for exams. Visit [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act.html) and [College Board](https://www.collegeboard.org/) for sample questions, test dates, registration and fee information.

Attending a community college? You may be required to take the Accuplacer or Companion placement tests. Your college will provide details.

#### Invest in Your Future
Save as much as you can for your college education. Here are some strategies.

Put money aside. Create a specific savings account dedicated to college expenses. If you receive cash for birthdays or holidays, save a portion of that money for college. Also, get a part-time job and save half of your earnings.

Open a 529 College Savings Plan Account. A great college savings option is the Nebraska Educational Savings Trust or NEST. With this type of account, you can:

Earn tax-deferred growth on a wide range of investment options.
Use the funds at most post-secondary institutions.
Change which family member is the account beneficiary.
Friends and family can easily contribute to your account, which makes it an excellent gift. Find details at nest529.com.

Talk to a financial advisor. There are many ways to invest money. Meet with a financial advisor to discuss what strategies are best for your specific circumstance.
