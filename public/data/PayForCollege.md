#### Paying for College
The most common ways to pay for college include financial aid and savings.

Financial Aid
There are four types of financial aid that can help you pay for college. To determine if you qualify for grants, work-study, and student loans, you must complete the [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Some scholarships are also based on FAFSA results.

Grants are awarded to students who show financial need and are not repaid. They include the following.

* Pell Grant
* Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)
* Nebraska State Opportunity Grant
* College-based grants
* [Tuition assistance programs for Nebraska students](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/Tuition_Assistance.pdf)
Work-Study, also based on financial need, is money earned by working at a college-based job.

Federal student loans are money that is borrowed and must be repaid once you’re finished with college. Loans are also available for parents. See our [loan chart](https://www.educationquest.org/pdfs/loan_chart.pdf) for details.

Scholarships are awarded by private donors or your college and are not repaid. Some are based on financial need, while others are based on criteria such as academics, leadership, athletics, or talents. [Learn more](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/scholarship_tips.pdf) about scholarships and tips on how to earn them.

NEST 529 College Savings Plan
Consider investing in the [NEST 529 College Savings Plan](https://nest529.com/). The plan is a great way to save for your future education while also allowing for a Nebraska state income tax deduction.

Other Options
Private Loans are not funded by the federal government. Talk to your college financial aid office to determine if a private loan is an option. Carefully consider the interest rate and repayment terms before borrowing.

Military Education Assistance is offered by all military branches and includes the G.I. Bill, tuition reimbursement, and student loan repayment. Talk to a military recruiter for details.

#### Applying for Financial Aid
Don’t let the cost of college stop you from getting a degree. There are ways to cover the cost, including financial aid. Take these steps to start the process.

Create an Account

To begin the process of applying for financial aid, create a Federal Student Aid account at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/). Your parent will also need an account if you’re a dependent student.

Complete the FAFSA

The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is your application for federal, state, and college-based financial aid. Complete the form at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) in the fall of each year. The colleges you list on the FAFSA will use your information to award financial aid.

Submit the form before the colleges’ FAFSA priority date to get the best financial aid offers. Use our free [FAFSA Tools](https://educationquest.org/pay/fafsa-tools/) to help you prepare for and complete the form.

Renew the FAFSA every year you’re in college.

Expect a FAFSA Submission Summary

After you submit your FAFSA, expect a FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) via an email from Federal Student Aid. The FSS indicates your Student Aid Index (the number a college uses to determine how much financial aid you can receive), your eligibility for a Pell Grant, and if you were selected for verification. Some need-based scholarship applications will also require your FSS.

Be Prepared for Verification

Watch your student portal and email closely, as colleges may request verification of your FAFSA information. Respond to this request quickly, as the colleges will not process your financial aid offer until you provide the required documents. 

Expect Financial Aid Offers

The colleges you listed on your FAFSA will notify you of the types and amounts of financial aid they offer. You will only receive offers from colleges that accepted you for admission. Accept or decline the financial aid offers by the deadline.

The colleges will use this “financial need” formula to calculate how much to offer you in financial aid:

  Cost of Education – Student Aid Index = Financial Need

Apply for Student Loans

If you qualify for student loans, your college will direct you to [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) to complete the necessary forms. Depending on your financial need, you might receive a Subsidized Direct Loan (interest begins accruing after college) or an Unsubsidized Direct Loan (interest begins accruing immediately). Your college determines the amount you can borrow.

You must repay your student loan after you graduate or drop below half-time status. [Click here](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/loan_chart.pdf) for details about loan limits, interest rates, and repayment.

#### Finding Scholarships
Many resources are available to help you find scholarships!

Your school counselor is your best source for finding school-based and local scholarships. Visit the counseling office regularly during your senior year to stay updated.

Colleges provide numerous scholarships based on criteria such as your area of study, financial need, ACT/SAT score, and GPA.
