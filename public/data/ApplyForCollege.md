#### Meet the Requirements
As you prepare to apply to college, make sure you’re on track to complete the high school coursework required for college admission.

Check with your top college choices to learn their requirements, but most colleges are looking for the following core courses.

English – 4 years of intensive reading and writing.
Math – 4 years, including Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry – and one additional course that builds on a knowledge of Algebra.
Social Sciences – 3 years, including American and/or World History; one additional course in History, American Government and/or Geography; and a third course from any social science discipline.
Natural Sciences – 3 years, including Biology, Chemistry, Physics or Earth Sciences. One course must include a lab.
World Language – 2 to 4 years of the same language.
If you take dual-credit courses in high school, you could earn college credit at a lower tuition cost. Advanced Placement courses are another option for earning college credit. Ask your counselor if these courses are available at your school and if you qualify for a scholarship to cover dual-credit courses.

#### Retake the Tests
You took the ACT in the spring of your junior year, and you may have taken the SAT as well. To get the best score possible, retake the exam(s) in the fall of your senior year. Colleges will use your best score for scholarship and admission decisions. 

Visit ACT and College Board to find sample questions and test dates and to register and pay fees. Click here for test-prep options.

Use these strategies to help ensure a higher score:

Get familiar with the exam so you don’t waste time on exam day.
Take official practice exams in all four subject areas. 
Focus your attention on the subjects you find most challenging.
Gather items needed for the exam the day before, including an approved calculator and sharpened pencils.
Arrive early and rested on test day.
Answer all the questions, there is no penalty for guessing.
Planning to attend a community college? You may be required to take the Accuplacer or Companion placement tests. Your college will provide details.

#### Narrow Your Colleges
By early fall of your senior year of high school, narrow your college choices to three or four. Start by visiting or revisiting your top schools to make sure they’re a good fit.

When scheduling campus visits, ask for an appointment with an admissions representative, financial aid counselor, and a faculty member in your areas of interest. Be prepared with a [list of questions](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/GoVisitQuestions.pdf). If you can’t visit in person, request a virtual visit.

Once you’ve completed your research and visited campus, it’s time to compare notes and pick your top college choices. Compare schools based on factors like academic programs, size, location, career preparation, internships, and social climate.

For additional details about your top choices, see [College Profiles](https://educationquest.org/myeducationquest/college-profiles/) and [Nebraska College Costs](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/Coll_Chart_web.pdf).

#### Apply Yourself!
Apply to your top 3-4 colleges in the fall of your senior year. Most colleges will require the following.

An application and fee. If you can’t afford the fee, ask your school counselor if you qualify for a fee waiver.
Official high school transcript, including your grade point average and completed high school coursework. Some colleges also request your class rank.
ACT/SAT scores.
Some may require an essay.
Our [College Application Checklist](https://educationquest.org/pdfs/College_Application_Checklist.pdf) will help you gather all the information you’ll need. If your school conducts an Apply2College event, you’ll get help with your applications during the school day.

Create an account with your college. Once you’re accepted for admission, the college will instruct you to create an online student account/portal for communications about financial aid, admissions, and other college-related matters.

Make your final college decision. In the spring of your senior year, select a school that offers your major, is the right distance from home, and fits your family’s budget. Notify the other schools of your decision and decline their financial aid offers.
